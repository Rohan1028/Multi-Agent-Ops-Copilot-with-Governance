# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Ops Copilot! This guide helps you get productive quickly and keeps contributions consistent.

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository and create a virtual environment (Python 3.11).
2. Run `make setup` to install dependencies and pre-commit tooling.
3. Use `make format` and `make lint` before pushing any changes.
4. Run the full suite with `make test`.

## Commit Style

- Keep commits focused; avoid mixing unrelated changes.
- Start commit messages with an imperative verb (e.g., `Add`, `Fix`, `Refactor`).
- Reference Jira tickets when relevant (e.g., `JIRA-123: Add approval guard`).

## Pull Requests

- Provide context and screenshots/logs when relevant.
- Ensure new features include tests and documentation updates.
- Tag reviewers early and be responsive to feedback.

## Reporting Bugs

Open an issue with:
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Reproduction steps
